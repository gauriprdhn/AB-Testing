        "The goal of A/B testing is to check whether a change (a treatment) is going to have a significant impact on the target population. It is a randomized controlled experiment in which we test 2 versions of the same variable and evaluate which performs better in the controlled environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How does it work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Familiarize yourself with the following terms before we proceed further:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hypothesis** refers to a claim  made about the population. Its a statement whose authenticity will be tested with the statistical analysis underlying the A/B testing. In a normal test environment, we have 2 hypothesis on hand, the Null Hypothesis ($H_{o}$) which states that any impact of the treatment observed on the sample population is purely by chance. The Alternate Hypothesis ($H_{a}$) is the one the researcher wants to prove as being true. It is the one where we believe that a treatment affected the response of the sample population.\n",
        "2. Generally in A/B testing we split the traffic (read, population) into 2 groups, **Control Group** and the **Test Group**. Each group is created/ obtained by random sampling (hence the process being referred to as a randomized experiment). It is very important to assure the randomness of the sampling process as it eliminates the *sampling bias* and we want our sample population to be as true a representative of the true (and significantly larger distribution as poosible)\n",
        "Let's understand the 2 groups in the classic context, that is from when A/B testing is used to access the impact of changes (treatment) made to a website. The samples obtained from the traffic to the version A (original) of the website is the control group whereas the samples from the traffic to the version B (enhanced) of the website is the test group.\n",
        "3. **Sampling Size** is a vital point of the experiment too as it determines how much we can overcome the *under coverage bias*. Too less samples may not help us cover the probable types of users for the product.\n",
        "4. **Errors during the test** There are two types of errors that may occur in our hypothesis testing:\n",
        "\n",
        "  *Type I error*: We reject the null hypothesis when it is true. That is we accept the variant B when it is not performing better than A.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *Type II error*: We failed to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. It means we conclude variant B is not good when it performs better than A.  \n",
        "5. **Baseline Conversion Rate and Lift:** The baseline conversion rate is the rate at which existings users sign up for the website whereas desired lift is the increase in the conversion rate which we are trying to achieve with the changes to design implemented in the version B.\n",
        "6. **Significance Level:** Probability of the type I error, denoted by $\\alpha$. In simple words, its the probability that we will reject a null hypothesis when it is True.\n",
        "7. **P-value:** Just like $\\alpha$ supports the alternative hypothesis, p-value supported the null hypothesis. It is the probability that any observation is simply an occurance by chance.\n",
        "8. **Metric for Evaluation** is an integral part of our analysis. It determines how we will quantify the results of our evaluation and use them to make inferences about the data. \n",
