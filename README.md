# AB-Testing
Covering the practical implementation of A/B Testing using Jupyter Notebook (Python version). 
A/B testing is a classic statistical test for analyzing the effectiveness of the changes made to a website by conducting a randomized control experiment on the traffic to the website. To budding data scientists, it is a framework that details a classic practical use-case of data science. Familiarize yourself with the implementation of mathematical statistics in real- world via this repository. 

Practice (you can call it coding, whatever floats your boat) is the only way to answer the questions such as why and how what we learn in books could be implemented in practice in the industry.
